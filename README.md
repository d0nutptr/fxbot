# fxbot

This simple discord bot replaces links to posts containing https://twitter.com or https://x.com with links to https://fxtwitter.com, which fixes embeds!

## How to use
There are two ways to use `fxbot`:

1. You can use the official `fxbot` (hosted, by me, for free) by [adding it to your instance](https://getfx.bot). 

2. If you want to host an instance yourself, [create a discord bot token](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/). Then, install and launch the app as follows:

```bash
cargo install fxbot

DISCORD_TOKEN=<discord bot token> fxbot
```

Then add your bot to your discord instance.

## Problem?
If there are any problems with the bot, please reach out to me by [pinging me on twitter](https://twitter.com/d0nutptr) or filling an issue on this repository! Thanks!
